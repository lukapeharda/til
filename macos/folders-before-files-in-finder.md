# Have folders before files in Finder

OS X Sierra finally has an option for this type of behavior.

## Instructions

Go to:
* Open Finder
* Open Finder menu then click on "Preferences"
* Go to "Advanced" tab
* Check the "Keep folders on top when sorting by name"

Now, when you sort by name, can see folders at top of files (like in windows).
