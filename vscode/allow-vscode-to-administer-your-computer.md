# Allow VS Code to administer your computer

Running `code` in terminal or running some terminal commands in VS Code prompts the "Visual Studio Code would like to administer your computer" prompt which asks MacOS user to allow this action.

You can remove this prompt by allowing VS Code to have full disk access.

Go to `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Full Disk Access -> Add Code` to give full disk access.
